\section{Experience}


\subsection{Research}

\begin{itemize}

\item{\cventry{April 2016--Current}{Research Intern}{Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory}{Livermore, CA}{}{Research/Development for automatic data processing of large disparate data sources for the purpose of creating machine learning models to predict HPC performance behavior.}}

\item{\cventry{June 2015--September 2015}{Research Intern}{Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory}{Livermore, CA}{}{Research/Development for large-scale data storage, parallel processing, and analysis of HPC performance data. Developed advanced methods for correlating memory data to application meshes and using memory access samples to predict performance bugs (in collaboration with several other student interns).}}

\item{\cventry{June 2014--September 2014}{Research Intern}{Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory}{Livermore, CA}{}{Research/Development for finding patterns and correlations in memory access data within MemAxes. Created Mitos, a data collection and program annotation tool.}}

\item{\cventry{June 2013--September 2013}{Research Intern}{Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory}{Livermore, CA}{}{Research/Development of data collection tools for memory access information. Created MemAxes, a visualization/analysis tool for memory accesses on complex hardware topologies.}}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Industry}

\begin{itemize}

\item{\cventry{January 2015--June 2015}{Performance Consultation}{Stratovan Corporation}{Davis, CA}{}{Research/Development for optimizing the performance of Stratovan's segmentation and detection algorithms. Helped them achieve a 4x throughput improvement.}}

\item{\cventry{June 2010--October 2012}{Software Research and Development}{Intel Corporation}{Folsom, CA}{}{Research/Development to showcase the capabilities of heterogeneous computing on Intel integrated GPU and CPU hardware using OpenCL. Created a debugging and analysis tool for OpenCL programs that eventually became the OpenCL Code Builder that is currently shipped with Intel's OpenCL SDK. Co-authored a patent for the hardware-agnostic OpenCL line-by-line debugging capability in Code Builder.}}
